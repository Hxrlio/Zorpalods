Both sides.

## Development?
Super casual. No guarantee of release.

## Goal?
Honestly, I have no idea. My friend Luke asked for this, and so he shall receive. The Zorpalod will have the following behaviours as he requested:
Do "stupid alien dance" when player is looking at them.
Spawn at day time.
~1x1.8x1
If they see a player and no player is looking at them, they will run & attack, giving blindness. They deal the same damage as a Zombie.

## Compatibility
Unknown, but no reason that there should be issues.

## Current stage?
Pre-development
